Planning:
I started by planning out the different files I would need and how they would be organized in the project folder. When I started the project I tackled issues in the following order
1. Basic html
2. Basic css
3. authentication
4. scss and bootstrap
5. game logic
6. game logic backend communication
7. clean-up

Future Improvements:
I have a few occasional issues with ajax's asyncronous functions that I would like to resolve if I had the time. I would also like to have spent more time on my aps' appearence. Multiplayer would have been interesting to implement, but I simply didn't feel I had the time.

User Stories:

1. A new player can register
2. Players X log in
3. Players X can log out
4. A new game can be started
5. Previous games can be loaded
6. Winner is displayed
7. Player's can see play statistics
