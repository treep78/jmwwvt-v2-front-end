# Getting Started

Most importantly, remember to **go slowly and be methodical**. That means you
should be testing your changes in-browser as you write each line or so of code.
Always be commiting. Deploy early and often.

Here's a rough sketch of what you should do and in what order:

1.  [ ] Sketch some rough wireframes for how the front end will look and act.
1.  [ ] Write out some user stories for the app. User stories are short of how a
    user interacts with your app, and follows the format "As a `<role>`, I want
    to `<do something>`, so that `<some goal>`.
1.  [ ] Model the entities in your app. Draw a diagram. Use your wireframes and
    user stories to drive you modeling process by asking "What 'things' are a
    user interacting with?"
1.  [ ] Create a repo that your project will use, and add a README to it.
1.  [ ] Create a simple front-end with HTML and CSS, and host the front end on
    GitHub Pages. Use your wireframes to guide your layout.
1.  [ ] Create the code to manage your game logic.
1.  [ ] Write jQuery code to handle browser interaction.
1.  [ ] Start communicating with the back-end using `curl`. Use this to begin
    writing your AJAX code.
1.  [ ] Add any additional features to your app.
1.  [ ] Finish your documentation. Make it high-quality.
