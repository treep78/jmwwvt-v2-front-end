# Tips

-   **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation,
    style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use
    whiteboards!
-   **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, debugger, alert statements,
    etc) to debug and solve problems.
-   Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and schedule a 1on1**
    when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game
    each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
-   **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
    you can always go back in time to a previous version.
-   **Read documentation** (jQuery especially) at home to better understand hwo
    the tools you're using work.
-   **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove
    later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events
    if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out
    how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the
    win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
